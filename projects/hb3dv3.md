# hb3dv3

A Geometry Wars-inspired space shooter that got out of hand.

**24,000+ lines of Rust + WGPU**

## What It Is

Started as "I want to make a twin-stick shooter." Ended up as a physics playground featuring:

- **Negative mass objects** - Things that fall up and repel instead of attract
- **Fractal generation** - Procedural cosmic geometry
- **GPU-accelerated particle systems** - Thousands of particles without breaking a sweat
- **Exotic physics experiments** - Because "what if gravity worked differently" is a valid design question

## Why

I wanted to see what happens when you stop saying "that's probably too complex" and just build the thing.
