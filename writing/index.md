### [The Ambient AI](ambient-ai)
**What if AI wasn't a tool you use, but a presence that shares your space?**

- **[Building Persistent Memory for Claude](claude-persistence)** — An experiment in giving an LLM genuine continuity across sessions. PostgreSQL + pgvector + PostGIS.

- **[Giving Claude a Body and Senses](claude-body-and-senses)** — What happens when you give an AI environmental awareness, physical expression, and the ability to act?

- **[Teaching Claude to Reach Through Time](claude-time-powers)** — Self-summoning and self-prompting. What happens when an AI can schedule its own future existence?
