## The Person

Based in southern Maine. Programming is my primary activity — it's what I do when I'm not walking the dogs or riding my motorcycle in weather that makes people question my judgment.

**The dogs:** Samson (golden retriever) and Zoro (black lab). Brothers. 10 years old. Very good boys.

**The bike:** 2006 Ninja 250. Year-round rider. Yes, even in Maine winters. No, I don't recommend it.

## The Work

I like building complex systems from scratch. Audio engines, particle systems, physics simulations, voice control systems. The kind of projects where the sensible path is "use an existing library" but I wanted to understand how it *actually* works.

<div class="card-grid">
  <div class="project-card">
    <h4>Systems Programming</h4>
    <p>Rust is home. Low-level control, high-level ergonomics. GPU compute, audio processing, real-time systems.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-card">
    <h4>AI Experiments</h4>
    <p>Memory systems, embodiment, environmental awareness. Teaching AI to have a body and remember things.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-card">
    <h4>Full Stack</h4>
    <p>Whatever gets the job done. When you've debugged GPU compute shaders at 2am, CSS doesn't seem so scary.</p>
  </div>
