# About

I'm sqrew. I build things in Rust.

Based in southern Maine. Programming as my primary activity. Two dogs (Samson and Zoro, golden retriever and black lab, brothers, 10 years old). Ride a 2006 Ninja 250 year-round because apparently I don't believe in seasons.

## What I Do

I like building complex systems from scratch. Audio engines, particle systems, physics simulations. The kind of projects where sensible people would use an existing library, but I wanted to understand how it actually works.

My focus is Rust and systems programming, but I'm comfortable across the stack — front-end, back-end, whatever gets the job done. When you've debugged GPU compute shaders at 2am, CSS doesn't seem so scary.

Currently experimenting with AI embodiment, memory systems, and weird hardware integrations.
