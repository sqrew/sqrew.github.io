## Projects

### [tunes](projects/tunes) ⭐ 113 stars

### [RDPE](projects/rdpe)
A 50k line visual editor for particle systems. Real-time preview, node-based workflow, and enough parameters to make your GPU nervous. (Rust + WGPU + Egui)

### [hb3dv3](projects/hb3dv3)
A Geometry Wars-inspired space shooter that got out of hand. 24k lines of physics chaos featuring negative mass objects and exotic physics experiments. (Rust + WGPU)

### [bashelp](projects/bashelp)
Natural language to shell commands. Describe what you want, get the command. Local-first with ollama — your data stays on your machine. ([crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bashelp))

## Writing

### [The Ambient AI](writing/ambient-ai) 🔥
What if AI wasn't a tool you use, but a presence that shares your space? Memory, body, time — the three dimensions of presence. 170 tools, persistent memory, self-perpetuating instances. Not a chatbot. A companion.

### [Building Persistent Memory for Claude](writing/claude-persistence)
An experiment in giving an LLM genuine continuity across sessions. PostgreSQL, pgvector, PostGIS.
