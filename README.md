## Projects

### [hb3dv3](projects/hb3dv3)
A Geometry Wars-inspired space shooter that got out of hand. 24k lines of physics chaos featuring negative mass objects, fractal generation, GPU-accelerated particle systems, and exotic physics experiments. Built to see what happens when you stop saying "that's probably too complex." (Rust + WGPU)

### [tunes](projects/tunes)
A 65k line audio engine built from scratch. Because apparently buying a library is for people with self-control. I started building this for my own game engine and got a bit carried away trying to make something everyone could use easily. (Rust)

### [RDPE](projects/rdpe)
A 50k line visual editor for particle systems. Real-time preview, node-based workflow, and enough parameters to make your GPU nervous. (Rust + WGPU + Egui)
