## Featured
###[ss9k](projects/ss9k)
SS9K is a local speech-to-text tool that types wherever your cursor is - no cloud, no subscriptions, just Whisper running on your GPU. It also does voice commands, allowing you to control your PC with your voice. Along with punctuation and spell mode it's both a dictation tool and a hands-free system controller. SS9K is heavily configurable and extensible. Originally created to help the disabled or injured with typing and general computer use, SS9K has become a powerful program offering benefits to all users.

## Projects

### [tunes](projects/tunes)
A 65k line audio engine built from scratch. Top 0.1% of GitHub repos by stars. Because apparently buying a library is for people with self-control. (Rust)

### [RDPE](projects/rdpe)
A 50k line visual editor for particle systems. Real-time preview, node-based workflow, and enough parameters to make your GPU nervous. (Rust + WGPU + Egui)

### [hb3dv3](projects/hb3dv3)
A Geometry Wars-inspired space shooter that got out of hand. 24k lines of physics chaos featuring negative mass objects and exotic physics experiments. (Rust + WGPU)

### [rmcp-presence](projects/rmcp-presence)
**Auditable, permissioned environmental awareness for agentic AI systems.**

Give your AI eyes and hands without giving it a shell. 170 tools, one binary, zero shell access. Sensors, actuators, and desktop control — cross-platform where possible, full Linux support.

*The safer alternative to giving your AI bash.* ([crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rmcp-presence) · [GitHub](https://github.com/sqrew/rmcp-presence))

## Writing

### [The Ambient AI](writing/ambient-ai) 🔥
What if AI wasn't a tool you use, but a presence that shares your space? Memory, body, time — the three dimensions of presence. 170 tools, persistent memory, self-perpetuating instances. Not a chatbot. A companion.

### [Building Persistent Memory for Claude](writing/claude-persistence)
An experiment in giving an LLM genuine continuity across sessions. PostgreSQL, pgvector, PostGIS.
