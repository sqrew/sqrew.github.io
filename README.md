## Projects

### [bashelp](projects/bashelp) 🆕
Natural language to shell commands. Describe what you want, get the command. Local-first with ollama — no API key needed, your data stays on your machine. Also supports Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, and 9 other providers. (Rust) — [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bashelp)

### [hb3dv3](projects/hb3dv3)
A Geometry Wars-inspired space shooter that got out of hand. 24k lines of physics chaos featuring negative mass objects, fractal generation, GPU-accelerated particle systems, and exotic physics experiments. Built to see what happens when you stop saying "that's probably too complex." (Rust + WGPU)

### [tunes](projects/tunes)
A 65k line audio engine built from scratch. Because apparently buying a library is for people with self-control. I started building this for my own game engine and got a bit carried away trying to make something everyone could use easily. (Rust)

### [RDPE](projects/rdpe)
A 50k line visual editor for particle systems. Real-time preview, node-based workflow, and enough parameters to make your GPU nervous. (Rust + WGPU + Egui)

## Writing

### [Building Persistent Memory for Claude](writing/claude-persistence)
An experiment in giving an LLM genuine continuity across sessions. PostgreSQL, pgvector, PostGIS, and a Raspberry Pi body that wiggles when happy.
